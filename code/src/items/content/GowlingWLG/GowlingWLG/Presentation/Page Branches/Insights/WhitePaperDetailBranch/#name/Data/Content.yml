        It is with great pleasure that we share with you our annual review of UK patent judgments in 2022: 'A Slightly Slippery Slope'.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The paper comprehensively reviews the patent decisions of the courts of England and Wales, laced with comment and opinion on the big issues arising. In a busy year for patent case law, the judgments in 2022 developed some legal tests, consolidated others, and on some points put out reasoning that we think invites a fair bit of commentary.<br />
        <br />
        Highlights include:<br />
        <br />
        What is the 'inventive concept' and is it the same for all purposes?<br />
        Does the implied licence doctrine have a place in the assessment of indirect (s.60(2)) infringement?<br />
        The first Formstein defence<br />
        The territorial reach of the Patents Act &ndash; into the North Sea?<br />
        Should American Cyanamid remain the test for the award of injunctive relief in 2023?<br />
        Can an online take-down amount to a threat of infringement proceedings?<br />
        When will the court permit alternative service out of the jurisdiction?<br />
        Who is the "Judge of the Year" for 2022?<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        .<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        A recording of our 26 January 2023 presentation, also entitled A Slightly Slippery Slope, will be made available separately.<br />
        <br />
